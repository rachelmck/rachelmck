## About Me!

**Assignment 1**

Here is some fun information about myself:

- My name is Rachel McKinnon
- ![This is me](Assignment1-1.JPG)
- I am majoring in Neuroscience
- This is my third year
- I enrolled in this class because I have an interest in research and data science
- I decided to major in neuroscience because there is so much that we don't know about our own brains and I find that fascinating
- Post-grad, I will definitely want to continue my education. Not quite sure what that may entail.
